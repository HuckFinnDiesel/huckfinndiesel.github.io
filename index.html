    <h2>Step-by-Step</h2>

	<p>First of all you can download kodi at <b><a href="https://kodi.tv/download/">https://kodi.tv/download/</a></b></p>
	
	<p><b>Skin Settings Part 1</b></p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Once Kodi is installed I like to go to settings, then interface settings.</li>
	  <li>Click to change the skin and then click get more. Scroll down to Arctic Zephyr and pick it.</li>
	  <li>Change Theme and Colours to "Dark with Dark Dialogs" and Large Fonts</li>
	  <li>Then click customize or configure skin</li>
	  <li>Change home menu style to Vertical</li>
	  <li>Then click over to the left and scroll down to "Furniture"</li>
	  <li>Disable Header. I really only leave the "clock," "media flags," and "now playing info" checked.</li>
	  <li>Then click over to the left and scroll down to "Extras," you can change your highlight color here. I usually use red but it's really whatever you want. Brighter colors don't usually look right.</li>
	  <li>Click back until you're back to the main kodi menu.</li>
	  <li>Go to "Settings">"System">"Add-ons"</li>
	  <li>Check "Unknown Sources"</li>
	</ul> 
    <p><b>Installing Addons:</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Click back until you're back to the main kodi menu.</li>
      <li>Hover over settings but don't pick it. Click left on your remote</li>
	  <li>Select "File Manager"</li>
	  <li>On the left side of the screen scroll down to "add source" and click it.</li>
      <li>Click on none and type exactly <b><a href="https://huckfinndiesel.github.io/repo/">https://huckfinndiesel.github.io/repo/</a></b> <i>Don't share this link.</i></li>
      <li>At the bottom you can name it whatever you want. I named it Firefly. Then click Ok.</li>
	  <li>Back out to the Kodi Menu again.</li>
	  <li>Click Settings. Then Click Add-ons.</li>
	  <li>Click "Install From Zip File"</li>
	  <li>Click "Firefly" or whatever you named it.</li>
      <li>Click "repository.firefly-x.x.zip" and let it load.</li>
      <li>Once you get a pop up saying it loaded, go back and click "Install From Repository">"Firefly">"Video add-ons"</li>
      <li>Scroll down to "Firefly" and wait for it to install</li>
    </ul>
	
	<p><b>Firefly Settings:</b></p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Go through "Settings">"Add-ons">"My Add-ons">"Video Add-ons">"Firefly" and click Open</li>
	  <li>Scroll down to "Tools">"Playback"</li>
	  <li>Change the Default Action to whatever you'd like: <b>"Directory"</b> will open a list of sources to play from after picking a show or movie, <b>"Auto-Play"</b> obviously just plays the source automatically.</li>
	  <li><b>"Hosters with captchas"</b> I have it checked because those streams are usually really good, but it'll pop up on screen asking you to go to a website on your phone to confirm you're not a robot (Usually olpair.com so I have it bookmarked on my phone) When I set up other people's kodi, I leave it unchecked since it's easier. so it's your choice.</li>
	  <li>Under tools on the side you'll see "Accounts" below "Providers"</li>
	  <li>Scroll down until you see "Trakt" and "Authorization"</li>
	  <li>When you click on Authorization it will ask you to go to <b><a href="https://Trakt.tv/authorize">Trakt.tv/Authorize</a></b></li>
	  <li>Log into Trakt on your phone or computer and go to that link</li>
	  <li>A code with letters and numbers will be on your Kodi screen, just input that into the Authorization link on your phone or laptop.</li>
	  <li><b>Bonus:</b> If you'd like to pay a subscription service for a lot of extra high quality streams, you can look at <b><a href="https://real-debrid.com/">https://real-debrid.com/</a></b>
	  <li>If you do want to pay for it, under the account settings in Firefly you'll see "Debrid-Service" under Trakt and IMDb.</li>
	  <li>Click "ResolveURL Settings" and follow the instructions for Real Debrid</li>
	</ul> 
	<p><b>Skin Settings Part 2</b></p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Go back to the Kodi menu and click "Settings"</li>
	  <li>Click "Skin Settings" then "Customise home menu"</li>
	  <li>The left side of the screen has your various Home Menu items and the right side is what each one does.</li>
	  <li>If you're starting from scratch Select the "x" on every menu item except "Settings" and "Power" to get rid of them</li>
	  <li>Then Click the "+" next to "Settings" and click the arrow up next to the new menu item to move it above "Settings"</li>
	  <li>Hover over "none" on the left and click to the right (Or hover over which menu item you want to update)</li>
	  <li>Click on "Choose Item For Menu"</li>
	  <li>"Add-on">"Video Add-on">"Firefly">"Search">"Create menu item to here"</li>
	  <li>Scroll down on the right to "Label" it usually defaults to "Search" but if you'd like it to say something else you can type that here</li>
	  <li>On the left click on the "+" Next to "Search"</li>
	  <li>Hover over "none" on the left and click to the right</li>
	  <li>Click on "Choose Item For Menu"</li>
	  <li>"Add-on">"Video Add-on">"Firefly">"Movies">"New Movies">"Create menu item to here"</li>
	  <li>Scroll down to "Label" and label it what you'd like</li>
	  <li>Scroll down on the right to "Widget" and do the same steps to get to "New Movies" and just say okay when it wants a label (This will pull up the previews on the home screen)</li>
	  <li>On the left click on the "+" Next to "New Movies"</li>
	  <li>Hover over "none" on the left and click to the right</li>
	  <li>Click on "Choose Item For Menu"</li>
	  <li>"Add-on">"Video Add-on">"Firefly">"My TV Shows">"Progress">"Create menu item to here"  (This is you progress on tv shows, it will show you which episode you've left off on for each series)</li>
	  <li>Scroll down to "Label"</li>
	  <li>Scroll down to "Widget" and follow the steps again to get to "Progress"</li>
	  <li><i>Extra info:</i> if you use Trakt to keep track of movies you want to see on your Watchlist, you can add a menu item called watchlist by following the steps above and navigating to "Add-on">"Video Add-on">"Firefly">"My Movies">"Watchlist">"Create menu item to here"</li>
	  <li>When adding menu items, if you don't want a preview on the side (or if there isn't one like for Search) don't add a widget.</li>
	  <li>Once you're done with the home menu you'd like go all the way back to the kodi home menu and it'll take a moment to update the settings and then you're done!</li>
	</ul> 
	<p><b>Removing Incursion</b></p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>After all the above is done, if you used to have Incursion on your device, it's not necessary anymore</li>
	  <li>Click "settings">"Add-ons">"My add-ons">"Video Add-ons">"Incursion" and click "Uninstall"</li>
	</ul> 

	<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
